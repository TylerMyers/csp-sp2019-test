    <p>Hello World!
    <p>My name is Tyler Myers. I was born in a test lab. They tested new diseases on me every day. It was a horrible experience and I wish I had someone there with me. Thats why I made this so I can invite you to this horrible test chamber where they inhumanely inject diseases right into our blood streams.
